# Immigration conclusion audit — running fixes

**Purpose:** running ledger of statistical, mathematical, logical, and data-science issues fixed while auditing immigration conclusions.

**Rule:** each entry names the broken conclusion, the evidence that changed it, what was edited, and what remains unresolved. This is not a final immigration position memo.

## 2026-06-15 — School-burden denominator correction

### Issue

The school-burden memo and a stale exported CSV still supported the conclusion that Mexico-origin adults had a crude annual federal-minus-school balance of about **-$13.5k/adult**. That result used the `origin_fiscal_scenario_2023` scenario subset denominator (~436,819 adults) after multiplying area-weighted per-pupil school spend by household school-age children. [DATA]

That denominator was wrong for a full Mexico-origin adult-stock conclusion. The live tensor now uses the full Mexico microsim adult denominator (~8,496,334 adults). [DATA]

### Evidence Checked

```sql
SELECT *
FROM v_three_layer_annual
WHERE population_group = 'mexico_origin';
```

Current DuckDB result from `warehouse/immigration_fiscal_union.duckdb`:

| federal_per_adult | school_per_adult | net_crude_per_adult | weight_adults |
|------------------:|-----------------:|--------------------:|--------------:|
| 1519.278 | 771.285 | 747.993 | 8496334 |

Scenario source check from `warehouse/immigration_lifetime_evidence.duckdb`:

| origin | scenario adults | avg federal net | area-wtd per pupil | school-age kids/HH | HH weight |
|--------|----------------:|----------------:|-------------------:|-------------------:|----------:|
| Mexico | 436819 | 1519.278 | 20907.09 | 0.9718 | 322540 |

The old ~-$13.5k conclusion came from dividing the household school burden by the scenario subset. The corrected school burden is about:

`20907.09 * 0.9718 * 322540 / 8496334 = ~$771/adult` [INFERENCE]

### Fixes Made

1. Updated `research/immigration-school-burden-per-adult-2026-06-15.md`:
   - Mexico-origin row now reads `$1,519` federal, `$771` school, `+$748` crude annual.
   - Removed the stale verdict that Mexico looks far worse than natives on crude static federal-minus-school math.
   - Added a revision note explaining the scenario-denominator bug.

2. Updated `research/immigration-scenario-composition-2026-06-15.md`:
   - Replaced obsolete `~$21/pupil` text with post-F-33 `~$20,907/pupil`.
   - Added a warning not to use `436,819` scenario adults as the full Mexico-origin stock denominator.

3. Updated `research/immigration-lifetime-fiscal-generators.md`:
   - Rewrote G-LIF-K01 so future audits check both F-33 units and per-adult denominator discipline.

4. Updated `infra/immigration-fiscal/build/build_country_fiscal_tensor.py`:
   - The tensor builder now exports `three_layer_annual_2023.csv` from the live `v_three_layer_annual` view.

5. Regenerated canonical staged CSVs under `infra/immigration-fiscal/build/stage3_proto/`, including `three_layer_annual_2023.csv`, from the live DuckDB view.

### Current Conclusion

The corrected finding is narrower and less rhetorically satisfying: the built annual **federal-minus-school** layer is **positive for Mexico-origin adults** under the current full-stock microsim denominator. [DATA]

This does **not** prove Mexico-origin immigration is all-government fiscally positive. The lifetime NPV, state/local surge, enforcement, courts, and episodic shelter layers are still separate and cannot be collapsed into this crude annual layer. [INFERENCE]

### Remaining Risk

The full-stock denominator may understate school incidence for recent-arrival or unauthorized subgroups if those subgroups are younger and more child-heavy than the full Mexico-born 25-64 stock. That is a legal-status/cohort split, not a license to reuse the scenario denominator for a full-stock conclusion. [INFERENCE]

## 2026-06-16 — NAS age-25 benchmark relabeled; current-stock NPV claim killed

### Issue

Several memos described the warehouse `lifetime_npv` rollup as "Mexico lifetime NPV" or treated the `+$387.7B` multiply-out as if it were the lifetime value of the current Mexico-born adult stock. The live tensor actually multiplies current ACS education weights by NAS Table 8-13 cells for an immigrant entering at **age 25**. [DATA]

That is a useful composition benchmark, but it is not an actual remaining-lifetime NPV for current residents. Current Mexico-origin adults in the microsim are not a cohort of new age-25 entrants: only `17.4%` are age `25-34`, while `53.2%` are age `45-64`. [DATA]

### Evidence Checked

NAS source text around Table 8-13 states that the table compares an immigrant entering at age 25 with a native-born person followed from age 25. [SOURCE: local NAS 2017 PDF via `pdftotext`; `external/lifetime/nas/nas_2017_immigration_economic_fiscal_full.pdf`]

### Fixes Made

1. Updated `research/immigration-mexico-npv-population-synthesis-2026-06-15.md`:
   - Reframed `+$45,631/adult` and `+$387.7B` as **synthetic NAS age-25 education-mix benchmarks**.
   - Added the current-age distribution warning.
   - Replaced "NAS mix negative for Mexico falsified" with the narrower claim that `<HS`-only application is falsified by education mix, while actual current-stock NPV remains unmeasured.

2. Updated `research/immigration-lifetime-unified-theory-2026-06-15.md`:
   - Relabeled the verifiable anchor as a synthetic age-25 benchmark.
   - Corrected the Mexico federal annual total: full microsim stock is about `$12.9B/yr`; `$664M/yr` is the scenario subset only.
   - Corrected receiver-vs-federal dominance language to match denominators.

3. Updated `research/immigration-country-fiscal-tensor-2026-06-15.md`:
   - Replaced stale pre-college-cell negative NAS rows with current positive synthetic benchmark rows.
   - Added a limitation that age-25 NPV benchmarks are not current-stock remaining-lifetime estimates.

4. Updated `research/immigration-lifetime-fiscal-generators.md`:
   - Added G-LIF-Q06: age-25 NPV benchmark is not current-stock NPV.
   - Corrected the remittance comparison to distinguish scenario-subset federal net from full-stock federal net.

5. Updated `infra/immigration-fiscal/build/build_country_fiscal_tensor.py`:
   - Tensor row notes now label `lifetime_npv` as a synthetic age-at-arrival-25 benchmark applied to current ACS education weights.

### Current Conclusion

The `+$45,631/adult` and `+$387.7B` numbers should be read only as **current education mix × NAS age-25 cells**. They kill a crude claim that Mexico-origin adults should all be mapped to the `<HS` NAS cell, but they do **not** establish the actual lifetime NPV of the current Mexico-born stock. [INFERENCE]

The corrected full-stock annual federal proxy is about `$12.9B/yr`; `$664M/yr` is a scenario-subset calculation and should not be used against whole-stock or city-episodic totals without denominator matching. [DATA]

## 2026-06-16 — Local school-flow unit comparison corrected

### Issue

`research/immigration-lifetime-country-approx-brainstorm-2026-06-15.md` still contained an iteration-table verdict saying **"Local per-pupil ≪ federal annual"** and calling it confirmed by `~$21k/pupil vs ~$1.5k federal/adult`. That comparison mixed units and was numerically backwards: `$21k/pupil` is not less than `$1.5k/adult`, and neither number is comparable until the school value is bridged to an adult denominator. [DATA]

The same table still carried superseded Mexico and MX+Central America lifetime rows around `−$79k`/`−$80k`, which came from the older `<HS`-heavy-only approximation rather than the current ACS education-mix benchmark. [DATA]

### Evidence Checked

Live DuckDB rollup:

```sql
SELECT population_group, fiscal_layer, effect_order,
       ROUND(value_per_adult_weighted,2) AS per_adult,
       ROUND(value_total_usd/1e9,3) AS total_b,
       ROUND(weight_adults,0) AS adults
FROM v_country_fiscal_rollup
WHERE fiscal_layer IN ('federal_annual','lifetime_npv')
  AND population_group IN ('mexico_origin','fb_lt_hs','mx_ca_cluster');
```

| population | layer | per adult | total |
|------------|-------|----------:|------:|
| Mexico-origin | federal annual | $1,519.28/yr | $12.908B/yr |
| Mexico-origin | synthetic age-25 NPV benchmark | $45,631.19 | $387.698B |
| FB `<HS` | synthetic age-25 NPV benchmark | −$109,000 | −$837.868B |
| MX + N. Triangle | synthetic age-25 NPV benchmark | $42,971.52 | $476.122B |

Comparable school-layer row from `v_three_layer_annual` remains about `$771/adult/yr`, making the current crude annual federal-minus-school row `+$748/adult/yr` for Mexico-origin adults under the full-stock denominator. [DATA]

### Fixes Made

1. Updated `research/immigration-lifetime-country-approx-brainstorm-2026-06-15.md`:
   - Replaced the stale Mexico and MX+Central America `~−$80k` lifetime rows with current synthetic age-25 benchmarks.
   - Replaced the invalid `per-pupil ≪ federal annual` verdict with the comparable adult-denominator statement: `$771/adult` school burden vs `$1,519/adult` federal proxy.

### Current Conclusion

The useful conclusion is not that local per-pupil costs are small. The corrected conclusion is narrower: after bridging to the current full-stock adult denominator, the built Mexico school layer is smaller than the narrow federal proxy on an annual basis, leaving a crude `+$748/adult/yr` federal-minus-school row. [INFERENCE]

This does not settle marginal school cost, descendant attribution, legal-status/cohort incidence, or receiver-city episodic costs. [INFERENCE]
